            <h1>Instructions</h1>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan or line it with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter. Allow it to cool slightly.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the melted butter and sugar. Mix well until smooth.</li>
                <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt.</li>
                <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
                <li>Fold in the chocolate chips or chopped chocolate.</li>
                <li>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan, spreading it evenly.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs (not wet batter).</li>
                <li>Allow the brownies to cool in the pan before cutting them into squares.</li>
            </ol>
